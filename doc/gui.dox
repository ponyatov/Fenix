@page guidoc GUI programming

You can use generic `use: wx` to get any imported module,
but GUI engine in Felix has some complex code,
so it was selected to use special GUI elements class subtree
implemented in Python.

Felix follows KISS principle, so make GUI in Python is much simpler than
making some translation layer toward wxPython module.
